# Colloquy

A website that allows anyone to build their own chatbots, just by adding some expected questions and answers.

Conceptualised and initially developed in a team of 4 during the Black Googler Network's University Hackathon. At the time, it placed 3rd in the People's Choice awards. I have developed in further individually since then.
